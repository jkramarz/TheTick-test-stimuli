This repository contains **logic analyzer recordings** of real access control readers, providing valuable test stimuli for developing and debugging physical access control implants firmware without direct access to wide range of physical hardware.

## Usage

The files are PulseView formatted. You can use PulseView to study temporal relations of the signals, decode and export the raw data.

## Contributing

If you have additional reader captures that could benefit development and testing, feel free to submit a pull request!
